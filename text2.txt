Plantation Drive: Organize a plantation drive in your local area, where individuals can come together to plant trees and other vegetation. This initiative not only helps to improve air quality, but also helps to combat climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The advantages of this initiative include improving air quality, reducing the risk of flooding, and providing habitats for wildlife.
