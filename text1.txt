Lake Cleaning Event: Organize a lake cleaning event in your local area to remove trash and debris from the lake. This initiative not only helps protect the environment, but also helps to improve the overall health of the lake and the surrounding ecosystem. The advantages of this initiative include improving water quality, reducing the risk of flooding, and increasing the population of fish and other aquatic life.
